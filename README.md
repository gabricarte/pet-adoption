# PetAdoption App

## General Overview

The PetAdoption app is a mobile application developed using React Native. Its primary goal is to facilitate pet adoption by connecting potential adopters with pet owners looking to rehome their pets.

The app retrieves fictitious data from two APIs: the Random User Generator API and the Dog API.

The app features three main screens: IntroScreen, PetListScreen, and PetInfoScreen.

- `IntroScreen`: This screen serves as the entry point for users and presents a welcoming message along with an image. Users can click on a button to begin browsing available pets.

- `PetListScreen`: Here, users can view a list of pets available for adoption. Each pet is displayed with its name, image, and gender.

- `PetInfoScreen`: This screen provides detailed information about a selected pet, including its image, name, gender, and information about the owner.

- React Native: A JavaScript framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.
